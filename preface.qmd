# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book was created as companion material for a semester graduate course on simulation and optimization. It is the author's 
opinion that in an age of rapid advances in the field of artificial intelligence, it is of utmost importance to focus not only on
machine learning, but to study in detail the techniques that make current advances in AI possible. From those, the areas of
simulation and optimization have the highest potential to reveal how intrincate current AI is intertwined with other
areas of mathematics, statistics and computer science. 

Simulation techniques are widely used in many scientific disciplines, ranging from climate models, epidemiology, and engineering to finance and logistics. These methods 
allow researchers and practitioners to analyze complex systems, evaluate scenarios, and make informed decisions when analytical solutions are infeasible or unavailable. 
Throughout this book, we will explore foundational concepts and practical approaches to simulation and optimization, providing both theoretical background and hands-on examples.
In the context of AI, simulation approaches can be used to produce synthetic data for training in situations where these data are scarce, expensive, or simply impossible
to collect. Another uses of simulation approaches include stress-testing algorithms, validating models under various hypothetical scenarios, and supporting decision-making 
in uncertain environments. By leveraging simulation, practitioners can gain insights into system behavior, identify potential risks, and optimize performance before 
deploying solutions in real-world settings.

Optimization approaches lie at the core of how machine learning is used in modern AI systems. Foundational algorithms like stochastic gradient descent make it possible to 
find optimal parameters for machine learning models using training datasets composed of millions of data points. Additionaly, optimization
algorithms are used for hyperparameter tuning and can be found at the heart of classical approaches like support vector machines and logistic regression. In this context, both 
classical and metaheuristic approaches play a pivotal role in finding optimal or near-optimal solutions which are used in the broader context of specific applications
in practice.

Throughout the book, we will assume that the reader has familiarity with linear algebra and calculus and possesses a good command of statistics and the basics 
of machine learning. Additionally, good background knowledge of the Python programming language is adviced for the practical part of this book.
