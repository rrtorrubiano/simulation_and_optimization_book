    "text": "This book was created as companion material for a semester graduate course on simulation and optimization. It is the author’s opinion that in an age of rapid advances in the field of artificial intelligence, it is of utmost importance to focus not only on machine learning, but to study in detail the techniques that make current advances in AI possible. From those, the areas of simulation and optimization have the highest potential to reveal how intrincate current AI is intertwined with other areas of mathematics, statistics and computer science.\nSimulation techniques are widely used in many scientific disciplines, ranging from climate models, epidemiology, and engineering to finance and logistics. These methods allow researchers and practitioners to analyze complex systems, evaluate scenarios, and make informed decisions when analytical solutions are infeasible or unavailable. Throughout this book, we will explore foundational concepts and practical approaches to simulation and optimization, providing both theoretical background and hands-on examples. In the context of AI, simulation approaches can be used to produce synthetic data for training in situations where these data are scarce, expensive, or simply impossible to collect. Another uses of simulation approaches include stress-testing algorithms, validating models under various hypothetical scenarios, and supporting decision-making in uncertain environments. By leveraging simulation, practitioners can gain insights into system behavior, identify potential risks, and optimize performance before deploying solutions in real-world settings.\nOptimization approaches lie at the core of how machine learning is used in modern AI systems. Foundational algorithms like stochastic gradient descent make it possible to find optimal parameters for machine learning models using training datasets composed of millions of data points. Additionaly, optimization algorithms are used for hyperparameter tuning and can be found at the heart of classical approaches like support vector machines and logistic regression. In this context, both classical and metaheuristic approaches play a pivotal role in finding optimal or near-optimal solutions which are used in the broader context of specific applications in practice.\nThroughout the book, we will assume that the reader has familiarity with linear algebra and calculus and possesses a good command of statistics and the basics of machine learning. Additionally, good background knowledge of the Python programming language is adviced for the practical part of this book.",
